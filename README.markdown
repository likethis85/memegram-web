Use pow for local dev - it'll make your life easier.
Map it to http://memegram.dev. Consider installing pow from the fork at
https://github.com/sj26/pow: it gives mdns recognition making local iOS testing
much easier (you can set your iOS build to look for
http://memegram.dev.MYMACHINENAME.local).

We're using Heroku for production as an experiment. Have fun.
